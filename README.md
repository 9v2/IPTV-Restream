## Use Cases
- Connect with multiple Devices to 1 Stream IPTV Stream.
- Proxy all Requests through 1 IP.
- Synchronize watching IPTV (PLANNED).

## Running
You can run this on your local linux pc/server to expose the stream to all devices in your home network. For test purposes you can also try it with WSL.


You can also run this external server.


**The app can be used with any frontend HLS player**
(I'll also provide a basic web-player later on)
