## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

### `Frontend`
A simple React webpage that can stream iptv streams in hls-format. Provides synchronized playback by using a constant delay. Also supports multiple IPTV streams (channel selection) and a chat if using together with the backend.

### `Backend`
A simple NodeJS web server that retrieves your IPTV stream, caches it, and converts it into an HLS stream, making it accessible via the web. Also supports multiple IPTV streams (channel selection).


## üöÄ Run

### Run with Docker (Preferred)

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antebrl/IPTV-Restream.git
```

Make sure to have docker up & running. Start with docker compose
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Open http://localhost

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If a channel/playlist won't work, please try with `restream through backend` option enabled. This fixes most of the problems! It leads to longer initial loading times. If you don't need synchronization, turn it off in the ‚öôÔ∏è or set the delay in the [config](docker-compose.yml).


### Run components seperately

If you only need the **restream** functionality and want to use another iptv player (e.g. VLC), you may only run the [backend](/backend/README.md).
<br>
If you only need the **synchronization** functionality, you may only run the [frontend](/frontend/README.md).


Be aware, that this'll require additional configuration/adaption and won't be officially supported. It is recommended to [run the whole project as once](#run-with-docker).

## FAQ & Common Mistakes

> Error: `Bind for 0.0.0.0:80 failed: port is already allocated`

To fix this, change the [port mapping in the docker-compose](docker-compose.yml#L40) to `X:80` e.g. `8080:80`. Make also sure that port X is open in the firewall configuration if you want to expose the application.
