# IPTV StreamHub

A simple IPTV `restream` and `synchronization` application with web frontend.


## ‚ú® Features

  - Helps with CORS issues.
- Synchronize IPTV streaming with multiple devices: Synchronized playback and channel selection.
- Share your iptv and watch together with your friends.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

### `Frontend`
A simple React webpage that can stream iptv streams in hls-format. Provides synchronized playback by using a constant delay. Also supports multiple IPTV streams (channel selection) and a chat if using together with the backend.

### `Backend`
A simple NodeJS web server that retrieves your IPTV stream, caches it, and converts it into an HLS stream, making it accessible via the web. Also supports multiple IPTV streams (channel selection).


## üöÄ Run

### Run with Docker (Preferred)

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antebrl/IPTV-Restream.git
```

Make sure to have docker up & running. Start with docker compose
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Open http://localhost


You can configure the project by editing the [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml).

### Run components seperately

If you only need the **restream** functionality and want to use another iptv player (e.g. VLC), you may only run the [backend](/backend/README.md).
<br>
If you only need the **synchronization** functionality, you may only run the [frontend](/frontend/README.md).


Be aware, that this'll require additional configuration/adaption and won't be officially supported. It is recommended to [run the whole project as once](#run-with-docker).
